# REST APIs with Flask and Python in 2023

## Description

Repository for holding notes over the Udemy class "REST APIs with Flask and Python in 2023". My hope is that another aspiring developer learning Flask via this Udemy class sees these notes and uses them as side-by-side supplimental code/notes or uses it to double-check the lesson material or maybe just a quick refresher days/months/years later.
