1. Complete function return_42 where 42 is returned
2. Make a function `my_function` where you take 2 args and return the multiplied result.

## Answer

```py
# Complete the function by making sure it returns 42. .
def return_42():
    # Complete function here
    return 42  # 'pass' just means "do nothing". Make sure to delete this!

# Create a function below, called my_function, that takes two arguments and returns the result of its two arguments multiplied together.
def my_function(x, y):
    return x * y
```
