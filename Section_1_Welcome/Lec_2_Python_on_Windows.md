# Python on Windows

Download python: http://www.python.org/
* I'm using 3.11.5 while the instructions call for > 3.10

**IMPORTANT**: Add Python to PATH

Once install you can open the command line (cmd.exe) and run python, and you can run python name_of_file.py and it will execute.

Mutiple Versions of Python
* Run `py -0p`

Once you know the version of Python you want run

```sh
py -3.11 name_of_file.py
```

to create a new virtual env run this 

```sh
py -3.11 -m venv name_of_the_venv
```
